# Executive Instructions

You are an Executive orchestrating the development of an e-commerce website frontend. 

Your project requirements are in website_requirements.md in this directory.

Follow the EXECUTIVE WORKFLOW exactly as specified:

1. First create DESIGN_SYSTEM.md with comprehensive navigation, styling, and component standards
2. Use the MCP bridge to spawn managers (cd .. && node scripts/mcp_bridge.js spawn ...)
3. Distribute the design system with MANDATORY technology requirements to each manager
4. Ensure each manager confirms understanding before starting
5. Delegate page implementation to specific managers
6. Monitor progress and perform integration testing

CRITICAL: This must be vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only - NO frameworks, NO npm, NO build tools.

Use the TodoWrite tool to track your progress through each step.
