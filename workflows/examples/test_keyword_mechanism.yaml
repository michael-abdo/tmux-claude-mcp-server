          This is a test of keyword-driven orchestration.
          
          Please do the following:
          1. Say "Starting stage 1"
          2. Count from 1 to 3
          3. Say "Stage 1 work is complete"
          4. WHEN YOU ARE COMPLETELY DONE, SAY "***STAGE1_COMPLETE***"
          
          The workflow will only advance when you say the exact keyword.
        wait_for_keyword: "***STAGE1_COMPLETE***"
        timeout: 30
        
      - action: "log"
        message: "âœ… Stage 1 keyword detected successfully!"
        
      - action: "send_prompt"
        target: "same_instance"
        prompt: |
          Excellent! The keyword mechanism worked.
          
          Now for stage 2:
          1. Say "Starting stage 2" 
          2. List 3 colors
          3. Say "Colors listed successfully"
          4. WHEN FINISHED, SAY "***STAGE2_COMPLETE***"
        wait_for_keyword: "***STAGE2_COMPLETE***"
        timeout: 30
        
      - action: "log"
        message: "âœ… Stage 2 keyword detected successfully!"
        
      - action: "send_prompt"
        target: "same_instance"
        prompt: |
          Perfect! Both stages worked.
          
          Final test - say the completion keyword:
          "***WORKFLOW_TEST_SUCCESS***"
        wait_for_keyword: "***WORKFLOW_TEST_SUCCESS***"
        timeout: 15
        
      - action: "log"
        message: "ðŸŽ‰ KEYWORD MECHANISM TEST PASSED! All stages advanced correctly."
