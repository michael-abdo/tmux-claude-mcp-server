      You are a specialist for code analysis. Please analyze the current directory structure:
      
      1. Run: find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.cjs" | head -10
      2. Count the total JavaScript files
      3. Identify the main entry points

  - id: run_tests
    name: Test Execution

      Now let's check the testing setup:
      
      1. Look for package.json and check for test scripts
      2. Run: ls -la test* tests* 2>/dev/null || echo "No test directories found"
      3. Check if there are any .test.js or .spec.js files
      
      When finished, respond with: TESTS_CHECKED
    trigger_keyword: TESTS_CHECKED
    timeout: 60
    on_success:
      - action: log
        message: "âœ… Test analysis completed"

  - id: generate_docs
    name: Documentation Generation
    prompt: |
      Finally, let's review documentation:
      
      1. List all markdown files: find . -name "*.md" | head -5
      2. Check if README.md exists and summarize its contents briefly
      3. Suggest one improvement for the documentation
      
      When complete, respond with: DOCS_REVIEWED
    trigger_keyword: DOCS_REVIEWED
