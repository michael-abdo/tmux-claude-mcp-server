      I'll acknowledge this trigger and perform a quick task.
      
      Current time: {{timestamp}}
      Trigger count: {{trigger_count}}
      
      Let me check the current directory and show you I'm responding:
    trigger_keyword: RESPONSE_ACKNOWLEDGED
    timeout: 60
    on_success:
      - action: log
        message: "âœ… Response completed at {{timestamp}}"
      - action: send_prompt
        target: current
        prompt: |
          âœ… Task completed! 
          
          I'm ready for the next TRIGGER_COMMAND.
          The monitor will keep watching for more triggers.
