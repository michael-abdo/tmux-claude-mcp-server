# Scope Contract Architecture
## Solution to the "Global Context, Local Scope" Manager Scope Creep Problem

## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

**Manager Scope Creep**: Managers were implementing entire projects instead of their assigned portions, even when given explicit scope assignments.

### Root Cause Analysis
The fundamental issue was a **"Global Context, Local Scope"** architectural flaw:

1. **Managers receive GLOBAL context** (complete DESIGN_SYSTEM.md, full project requirements)
2. **But are expected to execute LOCAL scope** (only their assigned portion)
3. **Role templates encourage comprehensive thinking** ("identify ALL tasks in your domain")
4. **No explicit coordination boundaries** between managers

### Example of the Problem
```
Executive tells Manager 1: "Create landing page and product pages"
Manager 1 receives: Complete 5-page website design system
Manager 1 role template says: "Identify all tasks in your domain"
Manager 1 reasoning: "My domain = e-commerce website = all 5 pages"
Result: Manager 1 implements entire website
```

## 💡 The Solution: Scope Contracts

**Scope Contracts** are legal-style explicit boundaries that provide global context while enforcing local scope.

### Architecture Principles

1. **Global Awareness + Local Execution**: Managers see the full project but have contractual boundaries
2. **Explicit Scope Definition**: Clear "you do this, not that" statements
3. **Coordination Interfaces**: Defined handoff points between managers
4. **Success Criteria**: Unambiguous completion definitions

## 🏗️ Scope Contract Structure

Every manager receives a scope contract with these sections:

### 1. 🌍 PROJECT OVERVIEW (Read-Only Context)
```
The complete e-commerce website has 5 pages total:
- index.html (Landing Page)
- products.html (Product Catalog) 
- product-detail.html (Product Details)
- cart.html (Shopping Cart)
- checkout.html (Checkout)

This project is managed by 2 managers working in parallel.
```

### 2. 🎯 YOUR SCOPE (Your Responsibility)
```
YOU are responsible for EXACTLY these deliverables:
✅ index.html - Landing page with hero section
✅ products.html - Product catalog with filtering
✅ product-detail.html - Product details with pricing

SCOPE RULE: Work ONLY on items marked with ✅ above.
```

### 3. 🚫 SCOPE BOUNDARIES (Explicit Exclusions)
```
YOU are NOT responsible for:
❌ cart.html (Manager 2's responsibility)
❌ checkout.html (Manager 2's responsibility)
❌ Integration testing (Executive's responsibility)

BOUNDARY RULE: DO NOT work on items marked with ❌ above.
```

### 4. 🔗 COORDINATION INTERFACES (Handoff Points)
```
Your work must coordinate with:
• Manager 2: Ensure cart buttons link to cart.html
• Executive: Follow DESIGN_SYSTEM.md exactly
• All pages use identical navigation from design system
```

### 5. 📋 SUCCESS CRITERIA (Completion Definition)
```
Report completion when ALL of these are true:
✅ All 3 assigned HTML files exist and function
✅ Navigation works between your pages
✅ Add to cart buttons save to localStorage
✅ Pages follow design system exactly

COMPLETION RULE: Report done when YOUR scope is complete.
```

## 🔧 Implementation

### Files Created
- `src/scope_contract_builder.js` - Scope contract generation system
- `src/test_scope_contract_solution.js` - Demonstrates old vs new approach
- `scripts/spawn_website_exec_with_scope_contracts.js` - Updated spawn script

### Key Functions
```javascript
// Build scope contract for landing/product pages manager
buildLandingPagesManagerContract(managerId, projectOverview)

// Build scope contract for cart/checkout manager  
buildCartCheckoutManagerContract(managerId, projectOverview)

// Wrap scope contract with manager context
buildManagerContextWithScopeContract(scopeContract, managerId, workDir, parentId)
```

### Integration Points
- **Executive Context Builder**: Enhanced to include scope contract examples
- **Manager Role Template**: Updated to emphasize scope contract compliance
- **Manager Context Builder**: Modified to accept scope contracts

## 📊 Before vs After Comparison

### 🔴 OLD APPROACH (Scope Creep)
```
Manager Context:
"You are responsible for creating landing pages for an e-commerce website"

Role Template: 
"Identify all implementation tasks in your domain"

Result: Manager implements entire website
```

### 🟢 NEW APPROACH (Scope Contracts)
```
Manager Context:
✅ YOUR SCOPE: index.html, products.html, product-detail.html
❌ NOT YOUR SCOPE: cart.html, checkout.html

Role Template:
"Read your SCOPE CONTRACT section completely"

Result: Manager works only within assigned scope
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **Prevents Scope Creep**: Explicit boundaries prevent managers from overreaching
2. **Maintains Coordination**: Managers still see full project context for consistency
3. **Clear Handoffs**: Defined coordination interfaces between managers
4. **Unambiguous Success**: Clear completion criteria for each manager
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Works for any number of managers and scope divisions

## 🔄 Usage Pattern

### For Executives
1. Create project overview with all deliverables
2. Divide work into manager-sized scopes
3. Generate scope contracts for each manager using builder functions
4. Include scope contracts in manager spawn contexts
5. Monitor managers stay within scope boundaries

### For Managers
1. Read SCOPE CONTRACT section first
2. Identify items marked with ✅ (your scope)
3. Note items marked with ❌ (boundaries)
4. Plan work ONLY within contracted scope
5. Coordinate through defined interfaces
6. Report completion when YOUR scope is done

## 🧪 Testing the Solution

Run the test to see the difference:
```bash
node src/test_scope_contract_solution.js
```

This demonstrates how scope contracts solve the "Global Context, Local Scope" problem.

## 🏁 Conclusion

**Scope Contracts** transform the manager coordination architecture from:
- **"Figure out your boundaries"** → **"Here are your explicit boundaries"**
- **"Don't work on other stuff"** → **"❌ Specifically don't work on X, Y, Z"**
- **"Coordinate somehow"** → **"Coordinate through interfaces A, B, C"**

This solves the scope creep problem while maintaining the benefits of global project awareness and coordination.
