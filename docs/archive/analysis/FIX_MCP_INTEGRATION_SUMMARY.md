# Fix MCP Integration - Summary

## Problem
Executives cannot access MCP tools (spawn, list, send, read, terminate) as callable functions, preventing proper delegation to managers and specialists.

## Root Cause
Despite proper configuration and MCP server registration via `claude mcp add`, the tools are not exposed as callable functions in Claude's interface.

## Solution Implemented: MCP Bridge

Created `mcp_bridge.js` that executives can call via Bash to access MCP functionality:

```javascript
// mcp_bridge.js provides command-line interface to MCP tools
node mcp_bridge.js list '{}'
node mcp_bridge.js spawn '{"role":"manager","workDir":".","context":"..."}'
node mcp_bridge.js send '{"instanceId":"mgr_123","text":"..."}'
node mcp_bridge.js read '{"instanceId":"mgr_123"}'
node mcp_bridge.js terminate '{"instanceId":"mgr_123"}'
```

## Test Results

1. **Bridge functionality**: ✅ Working
   - Successfully lists instances
   - Can spawn new instances
   - Enables executive→manager communication

2. **Executive behavior**: ✅ Correct
   - Understands delegation is mandatory
   - Tries to use MCP tools
   - Documents when tools aren't available

3. **Delegation pattern**: ⚠️ Requires bridge
   - Pattern is enforced behaviorally
   - Technical implementation needs bridge

## Usage for Executives

Executives should use these Bash commands:

```bash
# List all instances
Bash("cd ../.. && node mcp_bridge.js list '{}'")

# Spawn a manager
Bash("cd ../.. && node mcp_bridge.js spawn '{\"role\":\"manager\",\"workDir\":\".\",\"context\":\"Manager task description\"}'")

# Send message
Bash("cd ../.. && node mcp_bridge.js send '{\"instanceId\":\"mgr_123\",\"text\":\"Your message\"}'")
```

## Future Work

1. **Investigate MCP Protocol**: Understand how Claude is supposed to invoke MCP tools natively
2. **Native Integration**: Work with Anthropic to enable direct MCP tool access
3. **Automate Bridge**: Make bridge usage transparent to executives

## Conclusion

The hierarchical exec→manager→specialist pattern is successfully enforced at the behavioral level. The MCP bridge provides a working technical solution for tool access. Executives can now properly delegate work using the bridge commands.
