# Workflow Intervention Analysis

## Executive (exec_382355) Interventions

### 1. Large Paste Processing Stuck
**Issue**: After sending the large requirements message, executive showed "[Pasted text #1 +65 lines]" but was stuck on "Bypassing Permissions"
**Intervention**: Sent Enter key to trigger processing
**Time**: ~2 minutes after paste

### 2. MCP Tools Not Available
**Issue**: Executive tried to use spawn tool but didn't have it in available functions
**Error**: "I don't have the spawn MCP tool in my available functions list"
**Intervention**: 
- Sent message explaining how to use spawn tool
- Eventually spawned managers manually via mcp_bridge.js

### 3. API Error During Processing
**Issue**: "API Error (Connection error.) · Retrying in 1 seconds… (attempt 1/10)"
**Intervention**: Sent Enter key to continue

## UI/UX Manager (mgr_382355_598025) Interventions

### 1. Initial Context Processing Stuck
**Issue**: After receiving context, stuck on "Bypassing Permissions"
**Intervention**: Sent Enter key to continue processing

### 2. MCP Tool Unavailability
**Issue**: Tried to spawn specialists but MCP tools not available
**Error**: "command not found: mcp"
**Intervention**: Advised to work directly instead of spawning specialists

## Frontend Manager (mgr_382355_912571) Interventions

### 1. Initial Processing Stuck
**Issue**: Stuck after receiving initial context
**Intervention**: Sent Enter key to continue

### 2. Cannot Spawn Specialists
**Issue**: "Cannot spawn Specialists without MCP tools"
**Intervention**: Directed to work directly on implementation tasks

## Integration Manager (mgr_382355_143384) Interventions

### 1. Initial State
**Issue**: Blank/stuck after spawn
**Intervention**: Sent context message and Enter key

## Common Themes Identified

### 1. **"Bypassing Permissions" Freeze Pattern**
- **Frequency**: 100% of instances
- **Trigger**: After receiving any message/paste
- **Solution**: Send Enter key to continue
- **Root Cause**: Claude CLI seems to pause when receiving input in --dangerously-skip-permissions mode

### 2. **MCP Tool Access Issues**
- **Frequency**: All managers and executive
- **Issue**: spawn, send, read, list, terminate tools not accessible from within Claude instances
- **Workaround**: External coordination via mcp_bridge.js
- **Impact**: Breaks the autonomous orchestration pattern

### 3. **Large Message Processing**
- **Issue**: Large pastes show as "[Pasted text #X +Y lines]" and freeze
- **Solution**: Enter key required to process
- **Affects**: All instances receiving large inputs

### 4. **Context Initialization Delays**
- **Pattern**: Every instance needs manual Enter after initial context
- **Timing**: Immediately after "You are [role] with ID [id]" message

## Intervention Timeline

1. **T+0**: Executive spawned
2. **T+2min**: Enter sent to executive (paste processing)
3. **T+5min**: MCP tool hint sent to executive
4. **T+10min**: Manual spawn of UI/UX Manager
5. **T+12min**: Enter sent to UI/UX Manager
6. **T+15min**: Manual spawn of Frontend Manager
7. **T+17min**: Enter sent to Frontend Manager
8. **T+20min**: Manual spawn of Integration Manager
9. **T+22min**: Enter sent to Integration Manager
10. **T+25min**: Batch Enter sent to all instances
11. **T+27min**: Direct work instructions sent (skip specialist spawning)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Claude CLI Input Handling
The Claude CLI in `--dangerously-skip-permissions` mode appears to pause after receiving input, requiring manual Enter key to process. This affects:
- Initial instance messages
- Large paste operations
- Any message sent via tmux send-keys

### Secondary Issue: MCP Tool Isolation
MCP tools configured in settings.json are not accessible from within Claude instances, only from the parent MCP server. This breaks the hierarchical spawning pattern.

## Recommendations

1. **Automated Enter Key Sending**
   - Add automatic Enter key after any message send
   - Implement in MCPTools.send() method

2. **Message Processing Timeout**
   - Add configurable delay after sending messages
   - Send Enter if no activity detected after X seconds

3. **MCP Bridge Integration**
   - Instances should communicate spawn requests to external bridge
   - Bridge handles actual spawning and communication

4. **Health Check System**
   - Monitor for "Bypassing Permissions" state
   - Auto-send Enter when detected

5. **Simplified Orchestration**
   - Consider Phase 1 approach (external orchestration)
   - Or implement request/response pattern via files
